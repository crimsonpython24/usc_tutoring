## Development Rules

- Please use `pnpm` to install all packages so that they and their dependencies are indexed correctly (especially happens in updating mutual dependencies)
- Please update `.eslintrc.yml` and `.prettierrc` if the current settings are outdated, inconvenient for development, look bad, or anything else
